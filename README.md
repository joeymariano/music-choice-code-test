# Applicant Project
Thanks for applying for a role with the ETV team at Music Choice!
We're excited to see what unique skills and perspectives you bring to the team.

The next step in our interview process is this small coding project.
The work you submit here will help us understand your current skill set, coding methodologies and alignment with our
core competencies.

## Instructions
Along with this `README` you should see two files:
- `data.json`
- `design.png`

The basic goal of this exercise is to generate a simple page which renders the list of songs in the `data` file
according to the `design`.

There are only a few rules to follow:
1. The `data.json` file must be loaded at runtime, not copied into your JS
2. Use 'vanilla' JS - we know jQuery makes things easy, but for our purposes here we want to see _your_ code
3. sizes/colors/fonts are not required to match exactly
4. Do not modify the `data.json` file in any way

Submit your work back to your MC contact when finished.
We do not recommend spending more than an hour or so.
Feel free to embellish on the design/functionality so long as the basics are covered.
